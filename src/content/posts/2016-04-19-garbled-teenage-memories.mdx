    <h3 id="article:summary">Summary</h3>

    I've been thinking about a personal gift for a friend this year and I decided on doing a painting on canvas with acrylic colors.

    As the reader could guess from the title of this post, the motive is a mixture of different scenes of some precious shared teenage memories.

    The character style was chosen to mimic the one the South Park series is iconic for.
    Their preferred artwork usually sports large intensely colored areas, so this form execution was my goal for this work.

        <table>

                <tr>

    <h3 class="capitalize">Let's get on with it</h3>

    <h4 class="capitalize">Groundwork</h4>
    <Image src={series01} aria-describedby="series01" alt="Basic alpine scenery with lush greenery" />
    <p id="series01">
        The ground layer of the painting consists of a lush green foreground and an alpine background scene.
        A path to the top of the mountains winds its way right by the spectator of the scene.
    </p>

    <h4 class="capitalize">A sofa</h4>
    <Image src={series02} aria-describedby="series02" alt="The same scene with an added reddish sofa in the foreground" />
    <p id="series02">
        The next step was to add a comfy place to put our characters in.
        As memory serves the scene I had in mind played out on and around a flock of sofas.
    </p>

    <h4 class="capitalize">More details</h4>
    <Image src={series03} aria-describedby="series03" alt="Sofa and greenery became more detailed" />
    <p id="series03">
        I put another layer of a darker shade of red on the sofa for more details.
        This step also included adding details like blossoms on the greenery.
    </p>

    <h4 class="capitalize">Faceless figures</h4>
    <Image src={series04} aria-describedby="series04" alt="Included very basic characters" />
    <p id="series04">
        Now that the basic composition is set in stone - or rather in flesh, inside my head - I proceeded to add the silhouettes of our South Park look-a-likes into the scene.
    </p>

    <h4 class="capitalize">Faces without eyes</h4>
    <Image src={series05} aria-describedby="series05" alt="More detail was added to the figures, including mouths and hair" />
    <p id="series05">
        After the paint had dried I added more details to the characters like hair, mouths and clothing.
        A big chunk of respect had me postponing adding in the eyes, as these would determine the final look.
    </p>

    <h4 class="capitalize">Finally done</h4>
    <Image src={series06} aria-describedby="series06" alt="Characters with friendly eyes and more detail" />
    <p id="series06">
        The characters' eyes included I finished up the painting by adding more detail around the whole canvas.
    </p>

        <h3>Verdict</h3>
        <p>
            Another project finished.
            After initial problems getting the scene in my head on the canvas I'm pleased with the overall result.
            The South Park style characters work really well with the environment they're set in.
        </p>
        <p>
            In hindsight the work is probably a tad too big for a random birthday gift, ah well...
