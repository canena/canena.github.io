    <p>
        I've painted another acrylic painting as a birthday gift for the daughter of close friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the reader could guess from the title of this post, the motive is a mixture of different scenes of some precious shared teenage memories.
    </p>
    <p>
        The character style was chosen to mimic the one the South Park series is iconic for.
        Their preferred artwork usually sports large intensely colored areas, so this form execution was my goal for this work.

        <h3 class="capitalize">Let's get on with it</h3>

        <h4 class="capitalize">Groundwork</h4>
        <Image src={series01} aria-describedby="series01" alt="Hexagon pattern sketched out and started to paint the center piece" />
        <p id="series01">
            The base pattern of the whole painting is a honeycomb.
            I've sketched out the seven main hexagonal shapes with the help of some self-made paper templates and a pencil and filled them in with scenery that is meant to look like it's being viewed through a fish-eye lens.
        </p>

        <h4 class="capitalize">Blue Sky, Green Grass</h4>
        <Image src={series02} aria-describedby="series02" alt="More hexagonal tiles got their background filled with blues and greens" />
        <p id="series02">
            Each hexgonal tile contains a different scene representing a time of day or year.
            In this step I filled in the pieces that contain blue or green, like the sky and grass.
        </p>

        <h4 class="capitalize">Dawn in the fields</h4>
        <Image src={series03} aria-describedby="series03" alt="Background get more varied with yellows and reds" />
        <p id="series03">
            The hexgons that contain yellow and red begin to take shape.
        </p>

        <h4 class="capitalize">Details and the passage of time</h4>
        <Image src={series04} aria-describedby="series04" alt="All hexagon tiles now contain their respective backgrounds" />
        <p id="series04">
            After a few more rounds of refinement and adding details the background had finally been done.
            With all the backgrounds in place the composition now gives away that it's meant to resemble a kind of clock where the hands may wander through the scenes.
            This hand is an actual physical hand and is the next thing I prepared.
            I used the clockwork of a cheap no-name wall clock and placed it exactly behind the center of the piece with the pole sticking out through the canvas.
            Next I designed a bee out of primitive shapes all based around the topical hexagon - it would live at the end of the clock hand to circle the center through every scenery placed around it.
        </p>

        <h4 class="capitalize">Finally done</h4>
        <Image src={series05} aria-describedby="series05" alt="The finished painting with the bee attached to the clock hand" />
        <p id="series05">
            The finished painting has the bee swirling about the scenery attached to the clock hand; a bit of a hassle to transport but the effect is well worth the effort.

        <h3>Verdict</h3>
        <p>
            I'm very proud of this one, it came out just as I imagined, even the clock-work.
            Using paper patterns turned out to be sufficient but in the draft phase I would've appreciated if I had had pre-made ones available.
