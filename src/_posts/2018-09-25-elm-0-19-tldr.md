title: Elm 0.19 TL;DR
tags: elm
---

As [the Elm 0.19 upgrade docs](https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.19.md) are lacking some vital information you only know about by consistently hanging out on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.slack.com/) I thought I'd list them here for all the word to see.

* Massive compile time improvements
* Huge internal rework of the compiler that is prepared for the coming use-cases
* Many bugfixes regarding performance - i.e. pattern matching on tuples, many case branches, unnecessary recompiles, too much IO, memory leaks
* Removed many XSS attack vectors - i.e. disallowing `innerHTML` and inline event handlers
* Removed user defined operators, i.e. no more Narsil operators in user code :slightly_smiling_face: `<==|[======>`
* The already unpublished `Native` was renamed to `Kernel` and is no longer usable in user code, it always has been an implementation detail of the platform, native code is also built differently than before. Only [`elm`](https://github.com/elm) and [`elm-explorations`](https://github.com/elm-explorations) Github organizations can have `effect Module`s and `Kernel` code
* Many modules have been moved out of the Elm core to be able to update them separately without having to release a new language version
* Dead Code Elimination in production builds - smaller builds, opportunity for clever usage of compiler knowledge to improve runtime with `--optimize` flag for `elm make`
* New `elm.json` format that includes test dependencies and supports the distinction of libraries and applications
* `Array` is now faster and has some significant bugfixes
* The *magic* polymorphic `toString` has been removed in favor of specialized functions like `String.fromInt` and the like
* No more `Debug.crash` in production but is renamed to `Debug.todo` in debug mode
* Event, port and message handling is now synchronous by default (you can opt-in to async on demand) which supports cases where events in the DOM have to be handled synchronously, i.e. the Clipboard API
* Initialization on the JS side is done uniformly via `Elm.Main.init({ flags: {}, node: document.querySelector("#root") })`
* There is now `elm/browser` which contains navigation, page eventhandling and page visibility APIs
  - `Browser.application` with full SPA routing
  - `Browser.document` set `<title>`, control `<body>`
  - `Browser.element` simple TEA "widget"
  - `Browser.sandbox` simplified beginner program
* In addition to ports [WebComponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/) are proposed for specific use cases of JS interop
* The compiler can now [be built with Haskell Stack](/posts/2018-09-07-stack-to-elm-them-all) - `lts-11.20` for GHC 8.2.2 for now
