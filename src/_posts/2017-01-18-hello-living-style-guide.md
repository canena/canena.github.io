> Note that this styleguide has been moved over from an older version of the blog so this approach does not necessarily represent the way the markup is structured anymore. It shows, however, that embedding alternative styles into an existing page is a breeze when employing BEM blocks. The old styles literally live side-by-side with the new ones and the mild namespacing via `ui-theme` allows for selective theming on a per-subtree-basis.

This is the living documentation for my own little set of responsive Block Element Modifier (BEM) based CSS layout blocks being used throughout my blog. Don't expect any content here :-).
