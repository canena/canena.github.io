## My professional self

I'm a software developer by trait...

- with an abundance of experience in building frontends in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascaded Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript as well as a great number of libraries and frameworks that build on top of this foundation.
- having experience building backends with <abbr title="The C Sharp programming language">C#</abbr> for most of my professional web projects.

Currently obsessed with...

- using <a href="http://elm-lang.org" target="_blank">Elm</a> instead of JavaScript wherever it makes sense.

Formerly obsessed with...

- the <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr> methodology of writing <abbr title="Cascaded Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> with a little help of <a href="https://www.lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a>.


<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

If you're human, you can surely make sense of the following gibberish where you need to reverse the letters of every word *anenac (ατ) liamy • moc*.


<h2 id="impressum">Impressum</h2>

The views expressed in this blog are my own thoughts and don't necessarily match that of my professional acquaintances like my employer or co-workers, it is a fully private endeavor. I'm not responsible for linked content that lives outside of <em>canena.de</em> and it's subdomains, the respective owner's opinions are not my own and I distance myself from them and any affiliation that is not explicitly stated on my part.

<h2>Data Usage Disclosure</h2>

This is a static site, I don't collect any data myself although these pages are hosted somewhere and they might be keeping track of you. Enabling JavaScript is not required but might enhance the site experience by...

* providing code syntax highlighting powered by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
* occasionally providing asynchronous code loading for demonstration purposes with [require.js](https://requirejs.org), loaded from a CDN
* formula rendering is done using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) which is also loaded from a CDN
* nothing else as of now :-)

Shiny!
